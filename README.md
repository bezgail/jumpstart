#JumpStart

Jumpstart is a gem for quickly creating projects.
It does this by running options from a YAML file that you can create, or you can let the gem do it for you.
It's dead easy to do.

## Features
With jumpstart you can:

* Run many terminal commands in a specific order
* Create new projects of any type quickly from templates
* Create files from three different kinds of templates:
  * Whole templates. A like for like copy from the template to the new project.
  * Append templates. The template is appended to a file generated by a terminal command (e.g. rails)
  * Line templates. The template is inserted into a file generated by a terminal command at a specific line number.
* Replace strings in the newly generated project with specified tags (like the project name)
* Automatically configure local Nginx and hosts entries for a new project. (I'm using OS X so this is tailored for the Mac.)
* Remove unwanted files that may have been created by a terminal command (e.g. rails)

###Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
